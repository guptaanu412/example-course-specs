# Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

## Description

At the end of day, the value of Data Scientists rests on their ability to describe the world and to make predictions. Machine Learning is the field of teaching machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data - will a given tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam or not? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of Machine Learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, how to tune their parameters and how to tell how well they will perform on unseen data, all the while using real world datasets. You'll do so using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.

## Learning objectives

* Learn the key concepts of supervised learning and how to implement them on real-world datasets
* Learn to distinguish regression from classification problems
* Learn to evaluate how well your classification and regression modes perform
* Learn best practices in supervised learning, such as splitting into test/train sets and k-fold cross validation
* Learn how to improve model performance by both preprocessing your data and regularizing your models

## Prerequisites

* Intro to Python for Data Science
* Intermediate Python for Data Science
* Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)
