## Chapter 1: Classification

* Introduction to classification
* Introduction to scikit-learn datasets & plotting your data before ML
* Fit a model, use it to predict, and compute accuracy (k-NN) 
* Overfitting, underfitting and train/test split

## Chapter 2: Regression

* Introduction to regression
* The basic of linear regression (fit/predict + test/train split)
* k-fold CV
* regularization (Lasso; Ridge: Elastic net)

## Chapter 3: Fine-tuning your model

* Measures of model performance (Accuracy, F1, RMSE, & AUC)
* Regression diagnostics: residuals.
* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV; RandomizedSearchCV)
* Hold-Out set for final evaluation

## Chapter 4: Pre-processing and pipelines

* Imputing missing data (Imputer; Pipeline)
* Centering and scaling
* Dimensionality reduction: PCA
* Bring it all together: a Pipeline for Classification!
